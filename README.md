# Zirve Assignment

This is an AngularJs project which consists the following 3 pages;
• A "Home" page
• A "Series" page
• A "Movies" page

•How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Want to code as clean as possible, but also considered for future improvements

• Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Adding an application cache in the service layer to get rid of request calls on every page load

• What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Maybe adding an e2e test
